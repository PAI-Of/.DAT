# DotData (.DAT) â€“ Clean Data. At Dev Speed.

> Coding is easy. Finding high-quality, cleaned data is the real challenge.

**DotData (.DAT)** is an open-source initiative to make clean, structured, and license-safe datasets available for developers, researchers, and AI builders.

ðŸ”¹ Curated, AI-ready datasets  
ðŸ”¹ Built-in cleaning and normalization tools  
ðŸ”¹ Fetchable via API  
ðŸ”¹ Auto-license checker  
ðŸ”¹ Community-powered vault

## What we are going to do?
MAANG, OpenAI and even my brand (Powered Intelligece) suffer from the problem of finding good data for AIs.
So .DAT will find non CopyRight Data and Paste in this DB no code needed.
If you can help please help.

## Quick Start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PAI-Of/.DAT.git
cd .DAT
```
